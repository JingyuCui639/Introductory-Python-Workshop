# Python Workshop Materials

This repository contains materials for two Python workshops: Introduction to Python Workshop and Intermediate Python Workshop. The workshops are designed to provide a solid foundation in Python programming and data analysis for beginners and intermediate programmers.

## Introduction to Python Workshop

This workshop is an excellent starting point for beginners in Python programming. It covers the fundamentals of Python, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and data structures. We also explore essential Python libraries like `math`, `random`, `datetime`, `NumPy`, and `pandas`.

## Intermediate Python Workshop: EDA, Statistical Testing and Introduction to Machine Learning

This workshop is designed for intermediate Python programmers. It provides practical knowledge on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and a brief introduction to machine learning.

The workshop materials include:

- Techniques for EDA and data cleaning using Python.
- Implementation of traditional statistical models like ANOVA and T-Test using Python.
- A brief introduction to machine learning with Python.
